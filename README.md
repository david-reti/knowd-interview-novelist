# Knowd Technical Interview - David Reti

This project is an interesting showcase of my skills and learning abilities, in the form of a ~~simple~~ neural search project. The technologies used (in addition to the base CRA project) are **TailwindCSS** as well as **transformers.js** with the **instructor-large** model converted using **optimum** and the **hnsw** TS library for nearest-neighbor searching. A **web worker** keeps the UI nice and responsive ðŸ˜€

The primary focus of this project was the search functionality, and the underlying framework was not modified - the rest of this document is the default reference file generated by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which is of course still helpful.

**Note:** the converted model and precomputed embeddings are very large and therefore not included in this repository - after cloning the repo, download the zip file from [https://davidreti-net-main.s3.amazonaws.com/Models.zip](https://davidreti-net-main.s3.amazonaws.com/Models.zip) and extract the contents into [public](/public/) to allow them to be served to the client. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
